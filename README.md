## Development Tools

[Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) is the IDE that Facebook uses internally for JavaScript development. The killer feature of Nuclide is its debugging ability. It also has great inline Flow support. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is another IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers.

[Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) is a starter kit that uses Redux and a few different common UI libraries. It has a CLI to generate apps, components, and containers. If you like all of the individual tech choices, Ignite could be perfect for you.

[CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/) is a service from Microsoft that makes it easy to deploy live updates to your React Native app. If you don't like going through the app store process to deploy little tweaks, and you also don't like setting up your own backend, give CodePush a try.

[Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) is a development environment plus application that focuses on letting you build React Native apps in the Expo development environment, without ever touching Xcode or Android Studio. If you wish React Native was even more JavaScripty and webby, check out Expo.

The [React Developer Tools](https://devdocs.io/react_native/debugging#react-developer-tools) are great for debugging React and React Native apps.
